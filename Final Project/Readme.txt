Readme:

The code was tested and ran in RStudio R 3.2.6.

dataDirectory <- ("C:\\Users\\anand\\Desktop\\Machine Learning\\ML_Project\\Dataset\\")

This was the path in which datasets were kept. We can change according the location where files have to be tested.

The datasets which were used for testing has been attached in the attached set of files.

Two R files are submitted. 

For accuracy and kappa with cross validation : Classifiers_by_Cross_Validation.R 
For accuracy with split : Classifiers_by_split.R

Dataset is named as airbnb_dataset.csv

Based on the outputs generated from this accuracies were calculated and tabulated in the report present.

We can also read the comments in the R program files to get the accuracy and kappa values.
