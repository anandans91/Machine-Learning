This assignment is completed with the bonus track.

There are 3 java files namely, Driver.java, ID3Tree.java, RandomSelectedTree.java

We have to run the Driver.java file

The file can be run in the command line as follows.

The arguments of the file are :

<No_of_nodes_to_prune> <Algorithm_used> <training_set_path> <validation_set_path> <test_set_path> <Do we need to print the tree?> 

For example : 

0 1 dataset1/training_set.csv dataset1/validation_set.csv dataset1/test_set.csv 1  

is a valid set of argument that the java program can take.

No_of_nodes_to_prune - Can take any values from 0 to any number of nodes you wish to prune.

Algorithm_used - 1. ID3 Algorithm 2. Random Selection

training_set_path - Path of the training set

validation_set_path - Path of the validation set

test_set_path - Path of the test set

Do we need to print the tree? - 0. Don't Print 1. Print.
